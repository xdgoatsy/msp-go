# Backend Go Migration Cleanup Audit

**Audit date**: 2026-05-07  
**Capability recheck**: 2026-07-10
**Status**: CLEANUP COMPLETE, USER-OWNED RUNTIME VALIDATION

**Scope**: migrate the default backend runtime to Go, exclude legacy Python AI/Agent/OCR/LLM/math-solver implementation, keep incomplete Go AI capabilities behind explicit boundaries, and remove the legacy Python backend directory.

The canonical phase tracker remains `docs/backend-python-to-go-refactor.md`.

## Decision

The earlier audit kept `backend/` as a P8 comparison artifact because Python/Go double-run, exact error parity, nested DTO parity, browser smoke, Docker/Compose smoke, and performance baseline were not complete.

On 2026-05-07 the user explicitly decided to waive double-run/comparison in this workspace: "不用双跑，不用比对，我自己会测试，所以清理一下." The user then confirmed deleting `backend/`, including ignored `.venv`, cache, and old `uploads`.

## Cleanup Evidence

| Requirement | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---:|
| Go is the default backend runtime | `start.bat`, `docker-compose.yml`, `backend-go/Dockerfile`, `frontend/nginx.conf`, `nginx-site.conf`, `scripts/deploy.sh`, `scripts/update.sh` point to Go backend / `msp-migrate` | PASS |
| Legacy Python backend removed | `rm -rf backend`; `test -e backend; echo $?` returned `1` | PASS |
| AI boundary and implemented slices explicitly guarded | `backend-go/tests/contract/ai_boundary_surface_test.go` guards the legacy stack exclusion and dedicated `OCR_UNAVAILABLE` boundary; exercise application/HTTP tests cover transaction-free image-only rejection | PASS |
| Frontend calls statically covered or classified | `backend-go/tests/contract/frontend_route_surface_test.go` | PASS |
| Runtime double-run/comparison | User explicitly owns testing and waived blocking comparison for cleanup | USER-OWNED |
| Docker/Compose/browser/performance smoke | User explicitly owns runtime testing | USER-OWNED |

## 2026-07-10 Capability Recheck

The AI-adjacent Go routes are no longer accurately described as blanket TODO/placeholders. Admin provider/model/Agent configuration and the Eino Tutor, Portrait, Diagnostician, Math Solver, and Question Parser slices have executable implementations with documented local fallbacks. P6 remains `IN_PROGRESS`; this recheck does not claim full AI workflow completion.

`POST /api/v1/exercise/submit` supports text grading and diagnosis. Text accompanied by an image URL is still graded from the text. Because OCR is not implemented, an image-only answer now fails closed with HTTP `501` and code `OCR_UNAVAILABLE` before opening a transaction. It creates no attempt, diagnosis, learning session, or DKT update. The frontend no longer exposes the non-functional handwritten-answer upload path.

## Residual Risk

Because `backend/` is deleted, this workspace can no longer run Python/Go double-run or inspect the legacy Python implementation without restoring it from git history or an external archive.

Runtime API behavior, Docker/Compose smoke, browser/API flow smoke, performance baseline, and external live integrations are intentionally left to user validation per the user's instruction.

OCR, broader mathematical solving, token-level streaming, teaching feedback, and external provider quality still require P6 implementation and runtime acceptance evidence. The canonical status and per-slice verification record remain in `docs/backend-python-to-go-refactor.md`.
